RSS reader service project.  
I've missed Google Reader ever since we lost it 2013, I used it to track so many
of my news and tech streams.  
I've never created anything in Node.js and to be honest I've really never done
any JavaScript either. When learning I usually try to find a project to support
my learning path, this time it was time to miss Google Reader and for my learning
I will try to create something that mimics the lost but not forgotten service.  
Don't expect anything production ready in this repo, it's my personal playground
while I go through all the technologies needed to put this together.  
For now this repo is quite empty as I am still collecting the infomration on how
to go about the differnt parts.
